---------------------------------SCROLL: THE LEGION'S ELITE THREATS---------------------------------

To those who tread the shadowed depths of Xalora, heed this warning: the Legion has unleashed its most fearsome enforcers. Knowing them may be the only way to survive.

*** Wraith Mages
Masters of the arcane, corrupted by the Legion’s insidious grip.
Once scholars of distant worlds, these beings have become avatars of destruction. They wield terrifying powers to control the battlefield and protect their allies. If you face them, know this: they can teleport, heal their comrades, and unleash devastating energy blasts.

Abilities:
    -Teleportation: Blink across the battlefield to evade attacks or ambush you.
    -Healing Aura: Restore their allies’ health, prolonging even the toughest battles.
    -Arcane Strike: A focused blast of energy capable of immense destruction.

*** Weakness:
Wraith Mages are physically fragile. If you can outmaneuver their spells and strike decisively, they will fall.
Raptor Aliens

The Legion’s speed demons, relentless and blindingly fast.
These sinewy predators strike faster than the eye can follow. Raptors are designed for agility and hit-and-run tactics, overwhelming their enemies with sheer velocity. A lone Raptor is a deadly foe; in numbers, they are nearly unstoppable.

Abilities:
    -Blinding Speed: Close gaps or retreat before you can react.
    -Rapid Strikes: Deliver a whirlwind of attacks in seconds.
    -Disorienting Rush: Create afterimages to confuse and distract you.

Weakness:
Their speed comes at the cost of armor. Patience and precise timing are your best weapons against them.
Legion Soldiers

*** The disciplined backbone of the Legion’s war machine.
These heavily armed and well-trained operatives are formidable in their efficiency. They patrol in squads, using advanced tactics and overwhelming firepower to corner and eliminate threats. What they lack in supernatural abilities, they compensate with sheer numbers and superior weaponry.

Abilities:
    -Coordinated Attacks: Soldiers work in unison, using suppressing fire and cover to pin you down.
    -Advanced Weaponry: Armed with rifles, grenades, and protective gear to outlast most opponents.
    -Grenade Volley: Area-of-effect explosives designed to flush you out of hiding or traps.

Weakness:
Soldiers rely on their squad. Isolate one from the group, and their vulnerability becomes apparent.
Final Warning

The Legion will not rest until all resistance is crushed. Each of these enemies is a testament to their ruthless ingenuity. Prepare well, for the only way forward is through them.
May the shadows of Xalora guide you.

The Power to Break Reality

The Singularity Core grants more than weapons—it reshapes the world to your will. But power has a price. Use it wisely, or be consumed.
CORE ABILITIES

    Time Suspension – Freeze time for a few seconds. Perfect for dodging attacks or escaping, but some enemies may resist it.
    Reality Shatter – Unleash a shockwave that erases enemies and terrain. Use carefully—destroyed paths cannot be restored.
    Shadow Step – Instantly teleport a short distance. Bypass enemies, dodge death, strike unseen.
    Void Eruption – Summon cosmic fire, annihilating multiple foes. Unstable—may cause environmental damage.
    Phase Shift – Become intangible, passing through walls and traps. Stay too long, and you may never return.

THE COST OF POWER

    Overuse leads to Core Burnout—abilities may fail when needed most.
    Legion commanders detect heavy energy use—expect retaliation.
    The whispers of the Core grow louder. Ignore them, and you may lose yourself.

You are no longer just a bandit. You are something more. But how much of yourself will you sacrifice?

_The Path to Ascension_

Power is not given—it is **forged**. The wastelands of Xalora hide rare reagents that can enhance your body, mind, and abilities. Seek them out, and you may stand against the Legion as something more than mortal.

### **ESSENTIAL REAGENTS** _(Character Upgrades)_
- **Blood Iron** – Strengthens bones and muscles, increasing melee damage and resistance. Found in Legion weapon caches.
- **Void Essence** – Absorbs ambient energy, expanding your Core power reserves. Extracted from defeated Mages.
- **Neuron Crystals** – Enhances reflexes, increasing speed and reaction time. Grows in ancient underground caverns.
- **Phantom Ash** – Reduces noise and presence, making you harder to detect. Collected from burnt Shadow Beasts.

### **THE SHARDS OF THE CORE** _(For the True Ending)_
Scattered across Xalora are **Shards of the Singularity Core**, fragments of pure creation. Collect them all, and you may unlock the Core’s full potential.

- **Shards are hidden in the deepest ruins, guarded by the Legion’s strongest warriors.**
- **Each shard grants knowledge—but at a cost. The Core will test you before granting its truth.**
- **With all shards, a hidden path may reveal itself… leading to a fate beyond destruction or salvation.**

Many seek power. Few are worthy of it. Will you be the one to **rewrite destiny**?

-----------------------SCROLL OF THE WANDERER-----------------------

The ancient sewers of Xalora hold secrets and relics of past ages.
Below are objects that may aid you on your journey, should you find them
and choose to wield them wisely.

- Healing Elixirs
  Crafted from the rare herbs of the Luminescent Caves, these potions
  will mend wounds and restore your strength. Use them sparingly, for
  few know the art of their making.

- Weapons
  Tools of war, forged to strike fear into the Legion. They are scarce
  and powerful, but each shot spent is a chance lost â€” use them only
  when absolutely necessary.

- Energy Crystals
  Embedded with ancient runes, these crystals restore the mystical
  forces that fuel your special abilities. Handle with caution; their
  power is raw and unpredictable.

- Key of Shadows
  Rarely found, these keys open the guarded doors within the sewers.
  Each key is crafted by the Keepers, and only they know which doors
  they will unlock.

- Legion Relics
  These mysterious artifacts hold knowledge of the Legion's movements
  and tactics. Use them to gain insight into your enemy's plans, or
  trade them for resources if the opportunity arises.

May these items serve you well, wanderer, for the path is treacherous
and the trials many.

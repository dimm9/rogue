_Allies, Enemies, and the Chaos Between_

Xalora is not a unified world. It is a battleground of factions—some fight for survival, others for conquest. Whether you stand alone or forge uneasy alliances, knowing who roams the wastelands may keep you alive.

### **BANDIT GROUPS** _(Survivors of Xalora)_

#### **1. The Ash Fangs** – _Ghosts of the Wasteland_
- Masters of stealth and ambush tactics, they strike from the shadows.
- Will trade rare gear for information—but betray them, and you will never see the blade that ends you.

#### **2. Bone Vultures** – _Scavengers and Smugglers_
- Travel in armored convoys, stripping battlefields clean of weapons and tech.
- Will sell supplies—for a price. Steal from them, and they will hunt you across the planet.

#### **3. Red Vultures** – _Bloodthirsty Marauders_
- Killers who follow no rules but their own. They raid Legion outposts, but they’ll gut you just as easily.
- Avoid unless heavily armed. If forced to fight, strike first—mercy is wasted on them.

### **FOREIGN FORCES** _(Outsiders on Xalora)_

#### **1. The Legion** – _The Invaders_
- A relentless war machine, conquering worlds for resources. Their presence on Xalora is absolute.
- Led by **Overlord Seraphis**, a tactician who never loses. To defeat the Legion, you must break their command structure.

#### **2. The Syndicate** – _Off-World Arms Dealers_
- Not here to fight, only to profit. They supply weapons to **whoever can pay the most**—Legion, bandits, even you.
- If you have credits, they will deal. If you cross them, you will disappear.

#### **3. The Obsidian Order** – _The Watchers from Afar_
- A secretive alien faction with unknown motives. They do not interfere—but they are always watching.
- Some say they hold knowledge of the **true power of the Singularity Core**. If you find them, listen carefully.

The world of Xalora is lawless, and trust is fleeting. Choose your allies wisely—or walk your path alone.

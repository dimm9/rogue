The Singularity Core: A Choice with No Return

Beneath Xalora, in the burning veins of the planet, lies the Singularity Core. It is neither a weapon nor a shield—it is pure, limitless energy.

If you reach it, you must decide:

    Save Xalora – Activate the planetary defenses, repelling the Legion’s fleet. This will make you a hero, but Xalora will still bear its scars.
    Destroy Everything – Overload the Core, erasing the planet and the Legion in one final act. Nothing will be left—not even you.
    Take the Power for Yourself – The Core can be controlled, but at a cost. You will transcend mortality, but at what price?

The Core will not wait forever. Once you touch it, there is no turning back.

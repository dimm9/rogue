The Final War Has Begun

To those who stand against the Legion,

Xalora is on the edge of oblivion. The invaders have come, not as conquerors, but as harvesters. They will not leave until the world is stripped bare, its resources stolen, its people dead or enslaved.

Your only chance is the Singularity Core, buried deep within the planet’s molten heart. With it, you can decide Xalora’s fate. But the Legion knows of its existence—and they are already searching. If they reach it first, there will be no future left to fight for.

Your path will be long. The sewers will lead you to the Core, but danger waits in every shadow. The Legion has set traps. The air is thick with poison. And the things lurking in the tunnels? They are not all human.

Remember this:

    If the Legion catches you, they will kill you.
    If you hesitate, they will outmaneuver you.
    If you fail, Xalora burns.

The Core is waiting. Time is running out.

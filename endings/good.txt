^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Singularity Core hums with energy, brighter than ever before.
You stand before it, knowing that this is the final chance.
The Legion is closing in, but there is still hope for Xalora.
You can feel the power coursing through your body, and for the first time in your life,
you realize that perhaps you are capable of more than just surviving.

With a deep breath, you make your decision.
You channel the Core’s energy with precision, using its power to strike down the Legion’s forces.
One by one, their war machines and soldiers fall, helpless against the overwhelming surge of energy you’ve unleashed.
The Core responds to your will, and it sends a wave of revitalizing energy across Xalora.

The land begins to heal.
The scorched earth starts to regenerate, the skies clear, and life slowly returns to Xalora’s once-barren surface.
Where there was destruction, there is now rebirth.
The planet’s ecosystems begin to recover, and the people, once hopeless and desperate, now have the chance to rebuild.

The war is over, and the Legion is defeated.
Xalora is saved, not by a hero, but by a bandit who saw the possibility of redemption.

In the weeks that follow, Xalora’s cities begin to rise from the ashes.
People come together, working to restore what was lost.
The air is cleaner, the waters are purer, and the people are filled with hope for the future.
The flowers begin to bloom, their petals vibrant and alive, a symbol of the planet’s recovery.

Though you are still a bandit, you walk through the streets of Xalora with your head held high.
You may not have set out to save the world, but in the end, you did. And in the eyes of the people, you are a hero.
Xalora’s legacy lives on, and so does yours.

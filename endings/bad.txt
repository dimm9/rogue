You reach the Singularity Core at the heart of Xalora, your hands trembling with anticipation.
But as soon as you attempt to channel its immense power, everything goes wrong.
The unstable energy from the Core surges wildly, overwhelming you with its raw force.
You can feel it, the tremors deep within the planet’s core, vibrating through your bones.

With no time to think, you try to regain control, but it's too late.
A violent explosion erupts from within the Core, sending a shockwave of destruction across Xalora.
The skies darken as firestorms engulf the surface, and the ground trembles as the planet begins to fracture.

The flames consume the cities, the forests, the oceans, and every living thing.
The Core’s explosion rips through Xalora like a wound that can never heal, and the world that was once full of hope is now an empty, desolate wasteland.

As the last vestiges of the planet are consumed in the inferno, you stand alone, feeling the weight of failure crash down on you.
The planet is gone, and there’s nothing left to save. You realize with a sinking heart that the last hope for Xalora was extinguished by your own hand. Your decisions led to this end. Xalora’s fate is sealed, and so is yours.

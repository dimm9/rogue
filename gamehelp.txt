*Mission*
You’re a lowlife, a bandit from the dregs of Xalora.
But you are the planets last hope. The Legion — the merciless coalition from the outer universes—wants Xaloras
resources and won’t stop until every last bit is stripped away. It’s on you to find the Singularity Core, deep
within Xaloras inner core, and use it to either save or obliterate the world. Make it there first,
or watch the planet burn.

*Objective*
Locate the Singularity Core hidden in Xaloras core.
Decide the fate of Xalora — use the Core to defend the planet or to destroy it, leaving nothing for the Legion and take down the Legion leader.

*Controls*
Move: Arrow keys
Attack: q, e
Inventory Access: i

*Gameplay Tips*
Stealth or Strength: Choose how to approach each enemy — take advantage of surprise attacks in narrow sewer passages,
or face Legion warriors head-on.
Watch Your Resources: Limited resources mean every bullet, weapon, and ration counts. Waste nothing.
Navigate Xalora’s Sewers: The sewers are your path to the core, but it’s full of traps and Legion operatives. Keep your wits about you.
Use the Environment: The Legion won’t make this easy, but use the terrain and any cover you can find to outsmart them.

*Enemies*
Legion Warriors: Elite soldiers trained to hunt down threats like you.
Drones & Sentinels: Machines designed to patrol and eliminate resistance.
Elite Commanders: They won’t hesitate to call in reinforcements or use lethal attacks.

*Power-ups and Items*
Healing potion: Recover health; you will need every bit of it.
Weapons: Collect and use wisely — supplies are scarce.
Energy Boosters: For special abilities, the only thing keeping you alive.

Good Luck!
You’re no hero—just a bandit with a vendetta. But on Xalora, sometimes that’s enough. Get to the Core, and make it count.
